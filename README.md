# nft-marketplace
Creators around the world have a need to both mint their art as NFTs and have a means to sell them. This demonstration will include a simplified NFT MarketPlace that tests the concepts behind minting NFTs; transferring NFTs governed by time-based consignment smart contracts; and managing sale, commission, and transfer of NFTs.
